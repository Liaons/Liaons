<p align="left"> 
  A forestry engineer with a master's degree in recovery of degraded areas and PhD. Student in remote sensing - INPE. I've worked as a collaborating researcher on the MAPFIRE-MA project for CEMADEN and on PELD-PECJ2020 in a partnership between INPE and UNICAMP. 
  
  My interests lie in the carbon balance, between emissions by degradation drivers and removals through vegetative regrowth, as well as in trying to better comprehend fire dynamics in Brazilian ecosystems.
  
  Currently, I'm also a consultant in GIS and Data Science for remote sensing data to organizations like: CTrees (Pasadena, CA - USA), a non-profit corporation integrated with the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and the California Institute of Technology of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory - NASA (JPL - NASA); and IPAM - Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amaz√¥nia, a scientific, non-governmental and non-profit organization.
